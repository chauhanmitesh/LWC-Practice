# Daily LWC practice
This repository is dedicated to practicing Lightning Web Components (LWC) daily with real-world interview-level problems to improve skills and preparation for Salesforce development roles.


Each problem is inside a separate LWC component folder. The folder includes:
<component>.html → Markup for the component
<component>.js → JavaScript logic
<component>.js-meta.xml → Configuration file
<component>.css → External design file(optional)
